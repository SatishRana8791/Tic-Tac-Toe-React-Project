# Tic-Tac-Toe (React)

A classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built using **React** — a fun and interactive two-player grid game where players take turns placing **X** and **O** on a 3×3 board.

🎮 The goal is to be the first to get **three in a row** (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). If all squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a **draw**.

This project uses modern React principles and was built from scratch using **React + Vite**. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
